In this challenge, we will be using SQL database to design the tables to hold the data from the provided CSV files.

## Data Engineering
* Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
* Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table

## Data Analysis
* List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
* List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
* List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
* List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
* List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
* List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
* List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
